         *      YUI:
         *          1. Code is sandboxed
         *          2. Dynamic importing BEFORE anything is used, this includes fail-safes
         *              for not executing content on failure. Basically, only use what I need to, for
         *              my specific module
         *          3. Combo loader! One HTTP request, quicker load.
         *          4. Automatically searches the DOM for Y.all (returns a nodeList with TONS
         *              of functionality) or Y.one (returns node with all DOM functionality, plus more)
         *
         *      jQuery:
         *          1. Code is NOT sandboxed - anything can override this.
         *          2. When getting a dom object, I always have to make sure to access it
         *              like an array, since that's what it is.

         *  Summary:
         *      YUI: 
         *          * Allows any type of data to be imported: CSS, JS, Callbacks, Scripts, XML
         *          * Code is sandboxed, and class functionality is inherited, dynamically.
         *              e.g. I want to use the animation library? Just ask for it. I want to use
         *              the YQL library? Get BEFORE using and loading my classes
         *          * Has failture detection - it won't run the script before any of the sources
         *              has completed
         *          * Class being used, extends and incorporates other classes, in this case
         *              because it extends the event class, it can use 'triggers' without too
         *              much effort.
         *
         *      jQuery:
         *          * Dynamic importing has no fail-safe
         *          * DOES run callback function on success
         *          * Function is similar to a class - but not quite. It's missing the ability to
         *              inherit, and insead 'uses' the functionality from the scripts imported.
         *              Much like the YUI().use() call.
         *          * In this case, the callback function is 'sandboxed' but it's anonymous,
         *              so there's no reuse.
